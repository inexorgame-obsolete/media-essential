# Inexor Data Files

This repository contains all data for [Inexor](https://github.com/inexorgame).
It is intended as the core package, featuring up our main dependencies plus a few maps in ~300MB.
Anything else can get delivered via custom packages ingame.

## Licensing
A big problem we had to deal with when forking off Cube 2: Sauerbraten has been licensing.
This is why we decided to introduce a strict policy as you can find in [our wiki](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/wiki/License-Policy).

## How can I get involved / contribute?
Have a look in our [wiki](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/wiki/How-to-Contribute-Content).
