Legacy was speed-built in February 2015.
An abandoned and sacred safe-haven in an alternate world, where only the chosen can access. Fight to prove your worth!


Much thanks goes to:

 Khorne, for the improvements on the lighting.
 
 Zoocata, for the ruined building in the center of the map.

 Frosty and swatllama for suggestions and constructive criticism.
 
 Potato, greenadiss, and others for testing.

 Everyone who commented on quadropolis.us and sauerworld.org.

 Lee “eihrul” Salzman and Wouter “Aardappel” van Oortmerssen for the Cube2 Engine.

 The Inexor team for including my maps :).


Enjoy playing!
