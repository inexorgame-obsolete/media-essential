Pandora was created in August - September of 2014, with a few reworks into early 2015.


Back-Story: An alien laboratory has managed to open up Pandora's box, only to release a horrible curse which destroys everything living in the facility. You are sent in to investigate, only to find that an opposing race is there to do the same...


Much thanks goes to:

 Frosty, for spending countless hours on the server while I built, offering suggestions and feedback.

 Pyccna, for some geometry building and texturing, the idea of the "power cells", and the acidic lava idea.

 Skur, rabe, and Doko for tips on lighting, detailing, and texturing, which were all applied to this map.

 Savanha, for pointing out some flaws and offering feedback in game.

 Everyone who commented on quadropolis.us and sauerworld.org.

 Lee “eihrul” Salzman and Wouter “Aardappel” van Oortmerssen for the Cube2 Engine.

 The Inexor team for including my maps :).


Enjoy playing!
