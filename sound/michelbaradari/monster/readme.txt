Hello my name is Michel, I am a sounddesigner from germany. I am really surprised how cube has evolved. 
Sauerbraten looks really awesome now. However I think the sounds are a bit stale and do not fit anymore to the new look. 
So I decided to create new sounds for Sauerbraten. I recorded a lot of things and created new sounds by myself. 
After two weeks of hard working I have finally finished it. I think the sounds fit perfectly now and I hope you like it too.
